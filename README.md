# Introduction :microscope:


The goal of this project is to model the trajectory of an American football ball to determine the force and angle necessary to complete a pass given the coordinates of the quarterback, the direction and speed of the receiver making an estimation of the receiver-ball intersection.

The American football is a project that is affected by gravity and air resistance. Gravity causes the ball to fall toward the ground, while air resistance causes the ball to lose speed.

To model the trajectory of the ball, the equation of motion for projectiles will be used. This equation describes the position of the ball as a function of time.

The force and angle of the launch will be determined through an iterative process. Different force and angle values ​​will be tried until a throw that matches the catcher's coordinates is found.

This project has the potential to improve passing accuracy in American football. By determining the optimal force and angle for a pass, players can increase their chances of completing the pass.

Additionally, this project could be used to develop new training systems for American football players. These systems could help players develop the precision and skill needed to complete difficult steps.

Below are some of the challenges expected to be faced in this project:

    Air resistance is a complex factor that is difficult to model accurately.
    The direction and speed of the catcher may vary during the throw.
    The ball can bounce on the field, which complicates the calculation of the trajectory.

Despite these challenges, this project has the potential to be a valuable tool for American football players and coaches.





# Justification :telescope:
---
Potential impact

This project has the potential to have a positive impact on American football. The mathematical model and computer program could help coaches and players improve passing accuracy. This could lead to an increase in the number of passes completed, which could lead to an increase in the number of touchdowns and points scored.

Conduct exhaustive testing to ensure that the system works correctly in all situations.

# Metodology:satellite:
---
The mathematical model for the trajectory of an American football will be based on the laws of physics. The model will take into account the following factors:

    The force and direction of the throw.
    Air resistance.
    The gravity.

The computer program will be implemented in Python. The program will read the coordinates of the quarterback and receiver as input. The program will use the mathematical model to calculate the force and angle needed to throw the ball.

Expected results

The project is expected to achieve the following results:

    A precise mathematical model for the trajectory of an American football ball.
    A computer program that can calculate the force and angle needed to throw the ball so that the receiver can catch it.
